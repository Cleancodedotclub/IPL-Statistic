The Python IPL (Indian Premier League) Statistic GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a GitHub repository that contains code for a graphical user interface that displays IPL statistics. The code uses Python's Tkinter library to create a simple user interface that allows users to select an IPL team from a dropdown menu and display their win-loss statistics for a selected year. The data is sourced from ESPN Cricinfo and stored in a CSV file, which is then loaded into the program using Pandas library. The user interface also includes buttons for displaying the overall IPL stats, the top run-scorers, and the top wicket-takers for a selected year.
